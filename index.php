                <h3>Bugfix bugfix release 0.0.11.2</h3>
                <div class="news_body">
                 <p>The 0.0.11.1 release was too soon, an often occuring crash on exit and sometimes on startup crept in. That's why we've now released 0.0.11.2 which fixes this problem. We've also made the damage indicators float upwards.</p>

                <h3>The Mana World 0.0.11.1 bugfix release</h3>
                <div class="news_body">
                 <p>Quite a few annoying bugs that were relatively easy to fix were discovered right after the release of 0.0.11. That's why we've decided not to wait until 0.0.12 and instead release a 0.0.11.1 bugfix release just a few days from 0.0.11. See the changelog for details.</p>

                <h3>The Mana World 0.0.11 released</h3>
                <div class="news_body">
                 <p>This release marks a long due update to the world map, adding some more space to walk around and two new kinds monsters to fight with. Other than that highlights include smoother walking and support for walking diagonally and with the mouse, the upgrade to Guichan 0.3.0 and several stability fixes. See the changelog for details.</p>

                 <p>Meanwhile we have started development of our own server. It's still in very early stages but we're hoping to make good progress with that in coming months. Now could be the right time to check if you can help in its development.</p>

                 <p>Finally a note to those who have existing config files (for Linux users this is ~/.manaworld/config.xml): for the moment our server host has changed from animesites.de to www.lindeijer.nl!</p>

                <h3>0.0.10 Released!</h3>
                <div class="news_body">
                 <p>Don't let the numbering fool you, it's still a quality release. Sorry for all the chaps that were waiting for 0.1.0, but we're still kinda far from that release.. We're now going to maintain our almost monthly release schedule so you all can make lame jokes about "that time of the month".. wink</p>

                 <p>For those who will want to see the 0.1.0 someday soon, please help us. Once again our greatest need at the moment is the need for artists. So if you can draw (I'm counting stick figures as drawing so don't be afraid, we won't bite you) please contact us. Join the forums and come and greet us on the IRC channel (#manaworld on freenode).</p>

                 <p>Well then, I now have to leave you waiting for the 0.0.11 release (or you can always just use the CVS to get our latest results without waiting for us to package a release version for you).</p>
