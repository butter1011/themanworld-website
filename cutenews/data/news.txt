1168938889|Elven|The Mana World 0.0.22.1 released|Here we are again!<br />Not a big update, but this release should fix the annoying bug of player sometimes starting to walk when clicked on the GUI. Furthermore we switched to the new released Guichan 0.6.0 (When you want to compile from source be sure you have the latest version then).<br /><br />Older versions should still be working, but as always we suggest you to upgrade to latest one to have a better experience and to help us in development with your feedback.<br /><br />See you in game!||http://themanaworld.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/images/avatars/66016003407c4993aaa39.gif|||
1167156154|Bjørn|The Mana World 0.0.22 released|Back in version 0.0.20 we had introduced females, but until now their clothes looked the same as they would on a male. Version 0.0.22 fixes this, with clothing following the natural shape of the female body. The character selection dialog has also been upgraded, and will show your character with its full equipment. In shops, the list of items has been enhanced with icons. Aside visual improvements, monsters will now make sounds as they attack or get hit. <br /><br />Numerous smaller issues were fixed. Among them are trading money, NPC dialogs staying open on respawn and joystick enabled option. Also, you can now hold your mouse button to keep walking, and you can walk through other players if there is no way around them.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> Our update host changed to "http://updates.themanaworld.org". If you're upgrading from a previous version and hadn't changed it yet, either update it in your config file or delete your config file. In the latter case it will be recreated with the new default setting.||http://themanaworld.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/images/avatars/66016003407c4993aaa39.gif|||

The joystick can now be turned off for those who had problems with it.

1153816585|Bjørn|The Mana World 0.0.20 released|Females have entered our world! Admittedly this took us much too long, but thanks to hard work by Modanung on the spriteset, it is now finally possible to play as a woman. This release also adds new maps, monsters and a new hairstyle.<br /><br />On the technical side of things, this release brings a long awaited update to our animation system. It is now more flexible by having animations defined in XML. Also, some equipment is now visible on your player character, so you can finally start to show off your cool items to your friends! Finally, some corrections were made to the way the updating system worked. We may now actually be able to start using it reliably.<br /><br />It is important to note that due to these engine changes, it is required to update to 0.0.20. Older versions will no longer work properly.||http://www.lindeijer.nl/~bjorn/avatar2004_57.png|||
