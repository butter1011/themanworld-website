1. Intro

If you don't know what SVN is, I suggest you to just get the latest release.
There are currently no SVN snapshots available. If you want the latest
developments, you have to work with SVN and compile yourself, as described
below.

2. Get latest SVN

If you're a Linux user just type

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/themanaworld/tmw/trunk tmw

If you're a Windows user, follow this brief guide:

 0. Get TortoiseSVN at http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/ , install it, reboot if
    necessary.
 1. Go to the folder where you want your TMW SVN folder to be.
 2. Right click and choose SVN Checkout.
 3. In the URL of repository field, write "https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/themanaworld/tmw/trunk" without the quotation
    marks.
 4. Set the Revision to HEAD
 5. Press OK
 
When you want to update the SVN, simply right click in or on the SVN folder
called tmw and choose "Update SVN"
